# Testing and Verification

Tests should prove behavior through the same interfaces callers use. Confidence comes from observable outcomes at real seams, not from spying on implementation details.

## Vocabulary

**Behavior Test:** A test that asserts observable input or output behavior through a module's public interface or intentional system seam.

**Real Seam Test:** A test that replaces behavior through an intentional production seam: constructor-injected dependency, service layer, local database, in-memory or fake adapter, or runtime-provided binding.

**Property Test:** A test that checks a general property across generated inputs rather than only examples.

**Arbitrary:** A generator for valid or intentionally invalid test values, preferably colocated with the domain module it supports.

**Risk-Matched Evidence:** Verification where each material changed invariant, failure path, boundary, async behavior, persistence or runtime assumption, or user-visible consequence has proportionate evidence through the caller-facing interface or representative runtime.

## Non-negotiables

- Tests assert observable outcomes: returned values or failures, persisted state, emitted messages, rendered responses, sent fake-adapter records, or runtime effects.
- Tests do not depend on private helpers, internal call order, or incidental implementation structure when behavior can be tested through the interface.
- Do not use module-patching APIs such as `vi.mock`, `jest.mock`, or equivalents.
- Do not use method-spy APIs such as `vi.spyOn`, `jest.spyOn`, or equivalents.
- When replacing behavior, replace it through a real seam.
- Production adapters are tested through the same service-facing interface callers use.
- Tests that make deterministic claims control time, randomness, IDs, external dependencies, and cancellation when those inputs affect the outcome.
- A test must fail when the claimed behavior is absent.

## Verification completion criterion

Verification is complete when every material changed behavior, invariant, failure path, boundary, async behavior, persistence or runtime assumption, or user-visible consequence has proportionate evidence through the caller-facing interface or representative runtime.

If a representative environment is unavailable, name the unproven claim instead of presenting a lower-level test as proof.

## Strong defaults

- Prefer end-to-end tests for critical user flows.
- Prefer integration tests through real seams for adapters and service-module orchestration.
- Use focused behavior tests and property tests for pure domain modules.
- Use property tests for parsers, smart constructors, state machines, serialization round trips, normalization, idempotence, and lawful combinators when properties express the invariant better than examples.
- Colocate tests with the owning module using `.test.ts` or `.test.tsx` unless the repository has an established different layout.
- In Vite+ projects, run tests through `vp test` and import ordinary test APIs from `vite-plus/test` when that is the local convention.
- In Effect-heavy codebases or runtime-specific stacks, preserve the repo's established testing helpers and generators instead of inventing a parallel test harness.

## Behavior through interfaces

Prefer:

```ts
const result = await passwordReset.requestReset(email);

expect(result).toEqual(ok({ delivery: "queued" }));
expect(emailAdapter.sentEmails).toContainEqual({ to: email, template: "reset" });
```

The fake adapter is supplied through the production seam and exposes records for assertions.

Avoid:

```ts
const sendSpy = vi.spyOn(emailProvider, "send");
await passwordReset.requestReset(email);
expect(sendSpy).toHaveBeenCalledWith(...);
```

Interaction assertions are acceptable only when the interaction is the observable behavior, and then a fake or recording adapter supplied through a seam should own the record.

## No module mocks

Avoid:

```ts
vi.mock("../send-email", () => ({ sendEmail: vi.fn() }));
```

Prefer explicit seams:

```ts
const emails = new RecordingEmails();
const passwordReset = new PasswordReset(users, emails, clock);
```

Module mocks patch hidden dependencies. They encourage code without seams and tests coupled to implementation structure.

## Risk-matched evidence

Match evidence to risk:

- **Focused changes:** Verify changed behavior through the owning module interface.
- **Elevated changes:** Also verify affected external, persistence, concurrency, or runtime seams.
- **Critical or high-consequence flows:** Verify the end-to-end flow when a representative environment exists.

Do not demand tests just because lines changed. Map each material changed invariant, failure path, boundary, async behavior, or runtime assumption to evidence, and prefer the highest-confidence proof that remains proportionate. If a representative environment is unavailable, state which claim remains unproven rather than pretending a lower-level test proves it.

## Domain behavior and properties

Parsers, smart constructors, transitions, and pure decisions need focused behavior tests. Use properties where the invariant is general:

```ts
it.prop("normalization is idempotent", [emailAddressArbitrary], (email) => {
  expect(EmailAddress.normalize(EmailAddress.normalize(email))).toEqual(EmailAddress.normalize(email));
});
```

Valid arbitraries construct through production parsers, schemas, or smart constructors. Do not bypass invariants to create convenient test data.

Generate invalid boundary inputs when testing rejection, but do not label them valid domain values.

## Persistence behavior

When correctness depends on SQL, schema constraints, transactions, migrations, or query semantics, use a representative local database.

For persistence tests that do not depend on special runtime semantics:

- run the real migrations before the suite;
- exercise the production adapter through its service-facing interface;
- use a local substitute only when it preserves the behavior you are claiming.

A hand-written in-memory fake is not proof of SQL, schema, or transaction behavior.

When the claim depends on runtime-specific bindings, serialization, or scheduling, use the representative local runtime if the project has one.

## Runtime behavior

Use representative runtimes for platform contracts:

- Workers, serverless bindings, or generated env types;
- durable stateful runtimes;
- local database or object-store bindings;
- queue, workflow, or scheduled-job semantics;
- service bindings, WebSockets, alarms, or runtime serialization.

Node-only tests are not proof of runtime-specific behavior.

## Boundary and failure evidence

Changed parsers verify accepted and rejected shapes.

Changed projections verify intended consumer-facing output.

Changed codecs verify owned directions and round trips when both directions are owned.

Changed expected-failure, cancellation, retry, idempotency, or compensation paths are tested by observing semantic outcomes, not internal calls.

## Test integrity

Avoid:

- tests that only execute a path without assertions;
- returning `false` from a property callback without making the test fail;
- snapshots that do not encode stable semantics;
- retries that hide flakiness;
- mutable fixture state leaking through shared layers or resources.

## Rejected framings

- "It's a unit test, so mocks are fine." The seam matters more than the test label.
- "We tested the private helper." Callers use the module interface; tests should too.
- "Coverage went up." Coverage is not behavior evidence.
- "A fake proves database behavior." Fakes prove adapter contract behavior, not SQL semantics.
- "Node tests cover Worker code." Only when the behavior does not depend on runtime APIs.

## Review checklist

Use this as the final scan after applying the rules above; the rule source of truth remains in the relevant sections.

- Exporting internals just to test them.
- Verifying interactions with spies instead of observing fake-adapter records.
- Skipping rejected parser cases.
- Bypassing smart constructors in test factories.
- Not running real migrations in persistence tests.
- Claiming runtime-hop serialization works without running in the runtime.
- Forgetting to control clocks, random IDs, cancellation, or adapters.
